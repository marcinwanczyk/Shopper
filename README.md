I created a shopping list app. You can add items, edit them and delete. Made some functionalities such as sorting items, searching them.

# Starting App:
1. Run Spring Boot server
2. In the shopper-front directory, run Angular server: "ng serve" ( Supposing you already installed Angular )
3. localhost:4200
